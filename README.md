# Uber_Clone
This is a personal project focus on remaking the frontend of Uber for mobile using React Native and Google API
# Usage
To acctualy see and interact with the application you need to 

	1 - Install the "Expo" application in your mobile from "Google Play Store" or "App Store";
	2 - Go to the Command Line inside the App folder and execute "expo start"
	3 - Scan the Qr-Code that appears in the terminal using the Expo app previous installed in 		step 1
# Note
A ".env" file is needed inside the App Folder, containing a valid Google maps API key like:

```
GOOGLE_MAPS_APIKEY = <valid_key>
```
so that the app works as expected.
